## Meteor Mitigation Manager

Welcome to our project, submitted to SpaceAppsChallenge2025! 
Check out the more detailled description including demo videos under: https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/meteor-mitigation-manager/?tab=project

The Meteor Mitigation Manager is an real-time educational game, built to visualize the impact of asteroids on earth, the possible mitigation strategies and their cost and effort. As asteroid after asteroid tumbles towards earth, decide your mitigation strategies and learn from your mistakes. Make an endless stream of choices in real-time: will you save the earth by deflecting a random asteroid entirely? Have it crash into the ocean instead of a city? Invest in tsunami dams and shelters or early detection systems? Up to you to explore.

### Stack
- Vite (bundler & dev server)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- PixiJS 8

### Features Implemented
* Realistic Meteor Orbits, calculated from orbital mechanics.
* Realistic Lambert Trajectories for Kinetic Impactors from Earth to Meteors.
* Realistic preview of Meteor Impact on Earth, including Fireball, Blastwave, Earthquakes and Crater.
* Simulation of Environmental, Monetary and Human Losses based on real population data.
* Realistic mitigation strategies, all within a cost simulation.
* Simplified Mission Controls in a dashing UI.

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the code with git clone

#### 2. Install dependencies
```powershell
npm install
```

#### 2. Run Dev Server (hot reload)
```powershell
npm run dev
```
Vite will print a local URL (default: http://localhost:5173). Open it in your browser; edits under `src/` hot-reload automatically.


#### Use of AI
