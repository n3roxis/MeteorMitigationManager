# Threat Types

1. Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs)
2. Short-period comets or high-inclination NEOs
3. Long-period or dynamically new comets
4. Interstellar Objects (ISOs)
5. Short-warning small asteroids (city killers)


## Near-Earth Asteroids
- Semi Major Axis: 0.7 - 1.3 AU
- Eccentricity: < 0.6
- Inclination: < 30°
- Orbital Period: ~ 1 year

Warning time: Years to Decades
Typical Impact Velocities: 12–25 km/s (compare to Earth Orbit Velocity)

#### Interceptor Ideas:
Low-energy heliocentric transfer
→ direct transfer or 1-revolution Lambert arc
possibly including deep-space maneuver (DSM) for fine-tuning
example: NASA DART

## Short-period comets or high-inclination NEOs
Example: Comet Encke, 2008 TC3

- Semi-major axes: 1 - 3 AU
- Orbital Period: < 20 years (Jupiter-family comets)
- Inclination: any, can be very high, sometimes retrograde

Hard to track early, since they approach from non-ecliptic directions 
Warning time: months to a few years
Relative velocities: 30–40 km/s, can be higher

#### Interceptor Ideas:
High-Energy intercept (C3 > 50 km^2 / s^2)
Hyperbolic encounter trajectories from earth escape
Might require nuclear or hypervelocity impactors (like HAIV) concepts
Use Earth or Lunar gravity for speed or plane change

## Long-period or dynamically new comets
Example: C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring), C/2022 E3 (ZTF)

- semi-major axis: >> 100 AU
- Inclination: any, often retrograde

Warning time: months to possibly weeks
Relative Velocities: 50–70 km/s

#### Interceptor Ideas:
Rapid-response intercept 
Stand-by interceptor
→ Example: ESA’s Comet Interceptor waiting at Sun–Earth L2

"Intercept trajectories are fast flybys, not deflections — no time for orbit change."

## Interstellar Objects (ISOs)
Example: 1I/‘Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov

- Eccentricity: > 1 (hyperbolic)

Relative Velocities: 20–60 km/s
Extremely low probability of impact
Warning time: weeks


#### Interceptor Ideas:
Pre-deployed interceptors on standby
Require very high delta v at impact (> 30 km/s)
Flyby-only missions, deflection impossible


## Short-warning small asteroids (city killers)
Example: 2019 OK, Chelyabinsk (2013)

- 10-100 m diameter
- often approaching from the sun's direction

Warning time: days to weeks
"No time for orbit modification"

#### Interceptor Ideas:
Hypervelocity "terminal defense" concepts
"HAIV (Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle): nuclear payload with kinetic “lead” impactor to create a crater milliseconds before detonation."
Goal: fragmentation or velocity pertubation

## Notes

Earth Orbit Velocity: 30 km/s

# Orbits

2. Lambert Arc / Direct Transfer
3. Deep Space Maneuver (DSM)
3. Hyperbolic Encounter
4. Hypervelocity Interceptor



## Lambert Arc / Direct Transfer
Orbit around the sun 
Conic section between start and end, i.e. earth and asteroid (Lamberts Problem = connecting the two positions with an orbit)
Ofter perihelion near earths orbit, aphelion near asteroid

## Deep Space Maneuver (DSM)
small burn done mid course, not so interesting

## Hyperbolic Encounter / Gravity Assist
Maneuver connecting two lambert arcs, use gravity to change orbit
- Slingshot: Gain heliocentric speed for no fuel cost
- Easy change of delta V, e.g. to reach high inclinations
